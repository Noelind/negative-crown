<p>If you’re like me, you probably lived a very long (in digital terms), very public life before getting into privacy and
security. That means now that you’re into privacy and security, you’ve got a long trail of old, unused accounts either
from old services you stopped using (raise your hand if you still have MySpace) or from services you tried out and never
came back to. So this week, let’s talk about how to find those old accounts and what to do with them.</p>

<h2>Why Does It Matter?</h2>

<p>Before we dive in, let’s talk about why you should bother finding and neutralizing old accounts anyways. The short
answer is because these accounts are a risk. If you created these accounts back before you were into privacy, they
probably contain a lot of personal information about you like family members, friends, where you live/lived, your
lifestyle and interests, pictures of you, and so on. This information can be abused for anything from stalking to social
engineering and identity theft. Furthermore, social media scans are now considered a common part of employment
background checks. I don't know about you, but I would hate to get passed over for a job for something dumb I posted
five years ago that I might not even believe anymore.</p>

<p>Finally, as I often say, you should treat anything you post online as public record. Data breaches are a thing. 2020 saw
an average of 7 million records exposed per day. This means that the longer you have those old accounts sitting out
there, the more likely they are to get swept up in a data breach, exposing old messages, photos, email addresses, and
passwords. And again, since those accounts were probably made before you were into privacy and security, that means
they’re probably using a weak password that you’ve reused on other sites, opening the door for a domino effect of stolen
data, phishing scams, and stalkers. So yes, you should attempt to find and close as many of your old accounts as you
can.</p>

<h2>Seek…</h2>

<p>In order to close old accounts, you must first find them. You can probably remember many of them just by thinking back
on your life and remembering the services you used to use. MySpace, LastFM, LiveJournal, Tumblr, Yahoo, these are just a
few services that enjoyed a period of large popularity but have since declined. They may not be gone, but they’re not
what they used to be. Going through your head and looking back on your past will probably remind you of some of the more
prominent ones. But what about the ones you forgot?</p>

<p>There’s two main ways of finding old accounts. As much as I discourage the use of Google, I think they are probably the
best search engine to use for this step. If you’re like me, you probably had a small number of usernames you used almost
exclusively back in the day. Start by going to Google and searching those usernames in quotes, one at a time. The
quotation marks are important, because that tells Google “only search for this exact thing and show me exact matches.”
Once you’ve started running out of relevant search results, do the same thing but this time with your email address(es).
This will likely turn up any other accounts that were not username based.</p>

<p>Often times, especially if this is the first time you’ve done this, this will probably bring up several of your
accounts. Make sure to dig deep. Don’t stop at page 1, I recommend going to at least page 5 or 10 depending on how large
your internet presence has been in the past. Just keep going until you go through a couple pages in a row of results
that have nothing to do with you. This strategy will also likely bring up your personal information – like full name,
address, and phone number – on a lot of people search websites. This is something I plan to talk about in the future,
but for now this falls outside the scope of this post. If you're freaked out and feeling the urge to act immediately, I
recommend this workbook from Michael Bazzell. It’s the same one I use every year to check for and erase my own data.</p>

<h2>...and Destroy</h2>

<p>Once you’ve found these old accounts, you’ll probably be able to easily log into them. After all, you probably used the
same easy-to-remember weak password (or variation thereof) all over the place. Once you’re in, it should be fairly easy
to navigate the account settings and find a “delete my account option.”</p>

<h2>Should I Blank My Information First?</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of debate in the privacy community about whether you should delete your old data first or if you should
just go straight to the account deletion option. I think for most people, just immediately deleting the account is
plenty fine. If you have a history of stalkers or a similarly higher threat model (or you simply want to go the extra
mile), it may not be a bad idea to erase all the information or fill it with false information first and let it sit for
30 days before deleting it. I certainly don't think you're hurting yourself or exposing yourself to any extra risk by
doing so.</p>

<h2>What if I Can’t Delete My Account?</h2>

<p>Some websites make it a nightmare to delete your account (coughAmazoncough) but if you’re positive you’ll never use the
site again (or you can easily re-sign up if needed), I encourage you to go through this process. On the other hand, it’s
rare but some websites won’t allow you to delete your account even after contacting customer service (I’m looking at
you, FictionPress). If you live in Europe you can try to pull the GDPR card, but personally I think at that point
there’s a better solution: paint the walls, lock the door, and never look back. If a service refuses to let you delete
the account, empty it as much as you can. Delete names, bios, pictures, emails, everything you can. If something can’t
be deleted, then replace it with fake information – a black box instead of a photo (or a photo of a dog, not your dog),
a fake name, a forwarding email address, etc. Finally, change the password to the longest, most complex password the
service allows, log out, clear your cookies, and forget they exist. It may not be a bad idea to hold onto that login
information just in case. Regardless, the point is to make your account useless to anyone who looks. Stalkers won’t find
any useful information about you. Cybercriminals won’t be able to get into the account. As time goes on, any real
information they may have had about you will become more stale, so even if they suffer a data breach the exposure will
be minimal. It should be noted that this is not good advice if you’re facing a highly advanced and dangerous adversary,
such as being actively targeted by a government, but for 90% of my readers – the “average person” – this is a perfectly
good solution.</p>

<h2>When Not to Delete Accounts</h2>

<p>Real quick, it would be remiss of me to note that there are times I don’t recommend deleting your accounts. I was a
Google user for over ten years. I made the privacy switch several years ago and I still get the occasional email at my
Gmail address that I want: an old account I found that needs to be deleted, an old client looking to reconnect, etc. I
don’t ever recommend deleting any accounts you used for contact, two-factor authentication, professional or official
purposes, or that you actively used for long periods of time. I do recommend changing the information in those accounts
– removing names and such – using strong passwords and two-factor on them, and changing how you use them (ex: that Gmail
account forwards to my new primary email account and then deletes the message in Gmail. I respond from my primary
account, cutting Google out of the picture entirely). You run a serious risk when deleting such important accounts that
you may need them for something important at a later date. Make sure not to burn any important bridges.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>I preach privacy and redundancy. That means having multiple accounts in case something goes wrong with one of them. I
have both ProtonMail and Tutanota. I have several messenger apps and accounts, and multiple VPN services. This is in
both my personal life AND my life as The New Oil, so I’m not necessarily preaching digital minimalism. As we move
through life new, better services will pop up. Existing services will discontinue or become less desirable for any
number of reasons. That means we will constantly be making new accounts and abandoning old ones. The trick is to move
forward responsibly. If you make an account with a new service to test it out and end up not using it, be sure to erase
it. If you move on to a new service and decide not to keep the old one for whatever reason, be sure to erase it. Stay on
top of your stuff so that you can be future-proof. Don’t let past mistakes come to haunt present-you.</p>
